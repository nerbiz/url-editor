# UrlEditor

## Easily edit a URL

Simplifying adding/removing slugs, or changing GET parameters. A redirect method is added for convenience.

### Installation

Include this project with [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/):  
```composer require nerbiz/url-editor```

### Usage

There is no proper readme yet, but examples are available in the 'test' directory. I added that file for some personal testing, and it doubles as a 'tutorial' until I find some time to make a readme or wiki.
